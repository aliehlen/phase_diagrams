		<h2> Phase diagrams of colloidal crystals </h2>

		<div id="intro">
			<p> 
				This is a visualization of the results of many simulations of a system of colloidal particles. 
				The system is composed of two types of particles, large and small, where the small particles are 
				grafted with varying numbers of linkers. The linkers which are attracted to the large particles, and otherwise, particles are mutually repulsive. The mixture's 
				composition, or ratio of small to large particles, may also vary. Each simulation is initialized in a particular 
				crystal structure and ends in its equilibrium particar crystal structure (which may be different from the initial structure). 
			</br></br>
				On the left is a phase diagram mapping equilibrium crystal type as a function of temperature and number of linkers per small particle. On the right is a set of axes that hold 
				pair correlation functions (<em>g(r)</em>) when those are plotted. 

			</br></br>
				Usage:
				<ul>
					<li> Cycle through different compositions (ratio of number of small particles to number of large 
						 particles (#small:#large)) using the number toggle. </li>
					<li> Hover over points on the phase diagram for more detail on that simulation. </li>
					<li> Click on any number of points on the phase diagram to plots corresponding pair correlation 
						 function on the right. </li>
					<li> Zoom or pan the pair correlation functions as needed. Hover over points on the pair correlation 
						 for more information about each point. </li>
					<li> Remove plotted pair correlation functions by clicking on individual phase diagram points to toggle 
						 data on and off, or by clicking the "clear plot" button to remove all data sets currently visuzlied 
						 and reset the axes. </li>
				</ul>
                                For more information about these results, see the paper <em>Metallization of colloidal crystals</em> by Ali Ehlen, Hector Lopez-Rios, and
